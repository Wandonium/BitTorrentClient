# BitTorrent Client

A bitTorrent client (like uTorrent or Transmission) built with nodejs. The client lets you download a file given the .torrent file from any torrent aggregator like [piratebay](https://www.google.com/search?q=piratebay&oq=piratebay&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1981j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or [1337X](https://1337x.to/home/).

## Getting Started

Clone or download the project freely. To run the project use the following command:
```
node index.js a_file.torrent
```
where a_file.torrent is the .torrent file for the file you want to download.
The client is under development and can't handle multi-file directories yet or seed to peers. It can only download (leech) single file torrents from peers.

### Prerequisites

You will obviously need node to run the project which can be installed using:

```
sudo apt install node
```
which comes bundled with npm.

### Installing

Once you have node running you will need the following modules
* Bignum
* Bencode
* Crypto
* Dgram

These can be installed with npm in the following way:

```
npm install module
```

where 'module' is the module you want to install. For instance, to install bignum you would use the command:

```
npm install bignum
```

I have added a few .torrent files I used for testing. They mostly download ebooks and songs.
